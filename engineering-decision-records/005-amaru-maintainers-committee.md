# Amaru maintainers committee composition

## Context

Amaru is meant to be(come) a rather large and complex project, spanning over multiple years. 

The ambition of the project is to build a new fully interoperable block-producing node for improving the overall performance the Cardano blockchain. 

The Amaru node wants to provide a simplified entry point for building things on Cardano by using a modular design and Rust as its main coding language.

## Motivation

In order to manage the decision making on the project and have a compelling product oversight, Matthias and Santiago want to extend their maintainers committee's responsibilities to other members.

## Decision

Here is the new composition of the Amaru maintainers committee (scope owners of the project):

[Matthias Benkort - @KtorZ](https://github.com/KtorZ) provides the ultimate voice in decision-making regarding final integration and architectural designs. Furthermore, Amaru has close relationship with the following projects and their respective owners:

- Dingo (GO Node) owner: [Chris Gianelloni](https://github.com/wolf31o2) see: [Dingo Github](https://github.com/blinklabs-io/dingo)
- Dolos owner: [Santiago Carmuega](https://github.com/scarmuega) see: [Dolos Github](https://github.com/txpipe/dolos)  [Dolos proposal](https://gov.tools/budget_discussion/39)
- UTxO RPC owner: [Santiago Carmuega](https://github.com/scarmuega) see: [UTxO RPC Github](https://github.com/utxorpc) [UTxO RPC proposal](https://gov.tools/budget_discussion/40) 
- Pallas owner: [Santiago Carmuega](https://github.com/scarmuega) see: [Pallas Github](https://github.com/txpipe/pallas) [Pallas proposal](https://gov.tools/budget_discussion/41)
- UPLC VM owner: [Lucas Rosa](https://github.com/rvcas) see: [UPLC Github](https://github.com/pragma-org/uplc)

## Discussion points

- We need to have a diverse enough point of view in the maintainers committee to enlighten the decision making process
- Each scope owner on the project still has the decision making power for everything that relates specifically to his scope
- The maintainer committee reach a decision by having a minimum of four votes in favour of a decisions for it to be accepted
