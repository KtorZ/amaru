# Amaru maintainers committee composition

## Context

Amaru is meant to be(come) a rather large and complex project, spanning over multiple years. 

The ambition of the project is to build a new fully interoperable block-producing node for improving the overall performance the Cardano blockchain. 

The Amaru node wants to provide a simplified entry point for building things on Cardano by using a modular design and Rust as its main coding language.

## Motivation

In order to manage the decision making on the project and have a compelling product oversight, Matthias and Santiago want to extend their maintainers committee's responsibilities to other members.

## Decision

Here is the new composition of the Amaru maintainers committee (scope owners of the project):

| Matthias Benkort <br/> [@KtorZ][] | Santiago Carmuega <br/> [@scarmuega][] |Andrew Westberg <br/> [@AndrewWestberg][] |  Arnaud Bailly <br/> [@abailly][] | Chris Gianelloni <br/> [@wolf31o2][] |
| ---                               | ---                                           | ---                            | ---                            | ---                                                      |

[@KtorZ]: https://github.com/ktorz
[@scarmuega]: https://github.com/scarmuega
[@AndrewWestberg]: https://github.com/AndrewWestberg
[@abailly]: https://github.com/abailly
[@wolf31o2]: https://github.com/wolf31o2


The maintainer committee will be having a close relationship with the following scope owners:

- Amaru integration: Amaru Maintainers Committee (with final deciding member: [Matthias Benkort](https://github.com/ktorz))
- Ledger owner: [Matthias Benkort](https://github.com/ktorz)
- Consensus owner: [Arnaud Bailly](https://github.com/abailly)
- Mempool owner: [Andrew Westberg](https://github.com/AndrewWestberg)
- Peer 2 peer (P2P) owner: [Santiago Carmuega](https://github.com/scarmuega)
- Testnet facilitator owner: [Chris Gianelloni](https://github.com/wolf31o2)
- UTxO RPC owner: [Chris Gianelloni](https://github.com/wolf31o2)

The products that we will have a close relationship with also have the equivalent of an owner but since we won't be building anything for them (yet) we will only identify the person that manages that scope:
- Dolos owner: [Santiago Carmuega](https://github.com/scarmuega)
- GO Node owner: [Chris Gianelloni](https://github.com/wolf31o2)

## Discussion points

- We need to have a diverse enough point of view in the maintainers committee to enlighten the decision making process
- Each scope owner on the project still has the decision making power for everything that relates specifically to his scope
- The maintainer committee reach a decision by having a minimum of four votes in favour of a decisions for it to be accepted
