# Amaru maintainers committee composition

## Context

Amaru is meant to be(come) a rather large and complex project, spanning over multiple years. 

The ambition of the project is to build a new fully interoperable block-producing node for improving the overall performance the Cardano blockchain. 

The Amaru node wants to provide a simplified entry point for building things on Cardano by using a modular design and Rust as its main coding language.

## Motivation

In order to manage the decision making on the project and have a compelling product oversight, Matthias and Santiago want to extend their maintainers committee's responsibilities to other members.

## Decision

Here is the new composition of the Amaru maintainers committee (scope owners of the project):

| Matthias Benkort <br/> <img src="https://github.com/ktorz.png" width=50 height=50 /> <br/> [@KtorZ][] | Santiago Carmuega <br/> <img src="https://github.com/scarmuega.png" width=50 height=50 /> <br/> [@scarmuega][] | Pi Lanningham <br/> <img src="https://github.com/quantumplation.png" width=50 height=50 /> <br/> [@QuantumPlation][] |  Arnaud Bailly <br/> <img src="https://github.com/abailly.png" width=50 height=50 /> <br/> [@abailly][] | Chris Gianelloni <br/> <img src="https://github.com/wolf31o2.png" width=50 height=50 /> <br/> [@wolf31o2][] |

| Ledger & integration | Networking & UTxO RPC | Mempool & Middleware | Consensus | Ops & UTxO RPC |

[@abailly]: https://github.com/abailly
[@wolf31o2]: https://github.com/wolf31o2

[Matthias Benkort - @KtorZ](https://github.com/KtorZ) provides the ultimate voice in decision-making regarding final integration and architectural designs. Furthermore, Amaru has close relationship with the following projects and their respective owners:

- Dolos owner: [Santiago Carmuega](https://github.com/scarmuega)
- Dingo owner: [Chris Gianelloni](https://github.com/wolf31o2)

## Discussion points

- We need to have a diverse enough point of view in the maintainers committee to enlighten the decision making process
- Each scope owner on the project still has the decision making power for everything that relates specifically to his scope
- The maintainer committee reach a decision by having a minimum of four votes in favour of a decisions for it to be accepted
