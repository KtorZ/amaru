# Amaru design framework

## Context

Amaru is meant to be(come) a rather large and complex project, spanning over multiple years. 

The ambition of the project is to build a new fully interoperable block-producing node for improving the overall performance the Cardano blockchain. 

The Amaru node wants to provide a simplified entry point for building things on Cardano by using a modular design and Rust as its main coding language.

## Motivation

Given the ambition of the project, we need a structured approach to turn ambitions into concrete goals.

We want to have a unified structure to streamline development, ensure cross-team collaboration, and maintain focus on core objectives. 

This framework needs to enable efficient coordination across diverse teams and ensuring that all contributors align with the productâ€™s high standards for performance, security, and resilience. 

## Decision

Amaru will be using a customised framework adapted to the setup of the project :

<p align="center"><code>Representation of the development framework that will be used throughout the life of Amaru</code></p>

This representation encapsulates all the phases imagined for running the Amaru project :
1. Problem framing : [DDD : Framing the problem](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNpa1sM0=/?fromEmbed=1) linking together Problem, People, Outcome and Constraints
2. Solution architecture : [C4 Architecture](https://c4model.com/) representing the system and the interfaces between each key components
3. Solution flows and structure : [DDD : Bounded context](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNpa36mI=/?fromEmbed=1) focusing on use cases and structuring the delivery blocks of the solution
4. Manage release plans & interfaces : [Extreme programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) build a cycle with a release plan directed towards delivering a demo
5. Demonstrate : [Extreme programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) deliver on the features with acceptance criteria and KPIs to measure
6. Reflect and learn : [Lean Startup : Validated learning](https://theleanstartup.com/principles) allocate time to confront the solution to the problem environment and its user
7. Final solution deliver : [Lean Startup : Build, Measure, Learn](https://theleanstartup.com/principles) document the main delivery and discoveries related to the problems, prepare the next maintaining cycle

<!-- TODO: You can find the details of the first 3 steps here: <insert link to the documentation> -->

## Consequence

- This framework will apply to each scopes included in the Amaru project
- The scope owners have the responsibility to apply, break and update the content of this framework
- This will provide a documented overview of the product scopes and interfaces

## Discussion points

- We looked at various sources for encapsulating the _minimum structure necessary_ to structure the project

> * [Core mindset behind each step of Drive & Deliver](https://theleanstartup.com/principles)
> * [Extreme programming is the guideline for the Drive & deliver steps of the framework](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/extreme-programming-values-principles-and-practices/)
> * [Outcome driven methodology used to create the framework for Amaru](https://www.mobiusloop.com/blog/pka8i66gimn35593mck8f4ipwidenb)  

- We integrated feedbacks of experienced software developpers, project managers, product managers into our approach and kept just the necessary phases
